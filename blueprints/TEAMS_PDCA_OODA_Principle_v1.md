# TEAMS PDCA / OODA Principle v1

## 🧭 Overview
Defines the relationship between the two fundamental operational models inside TEAMS — **PDCA** (Plan–Do–Check–Act) and **OODA** (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act).

---

## ⚙️ Core Principles

### **PDCA — Execution Loop**
> **Reaction to stakeholder requests.**

PDCA is triggered by impulses coming from stakeholders, initiators, or orchestrators.  
Its purpose is to execute work correctly and consistently.

| Stage | Function | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Plan | Define the task | “Add support for Exchange X” |
| Do | Execute | Implement integration |
| Check | Validate | Review, audit |
| Act | Apply | Deploy, improve |

📍 PDCA lives **inside projects** and is **impulse-driven**.

---

### **OODA — Observation & Decision Loop**

OODA serves two core functions:

#### **1️⃣ Regular procedures**
Continuous, scheduled observation of the environment.

- Daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly reviews
- Monitoring APIs, markets, regulations, metrics
- Detecting shifts before they become incidents

#### **2️⃣ Critical view on PDCA**
Questioning each PDCA cycle:

> *“Should we do this at all?”*

OODA decides whether a PDCA loop:
- should be initiated,
- should continue,
- should be redirected,
- or should be stopped.

| Phase | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Observe | Gather signals |
| Orient | Interpret relevance |
| Decide | Choose direction |
| Act | Trigger or cancel PDCA |

📍 OODA lives **inside projects and in TEAMS Core**.  
It is **time-driven and context-driven**, not impulse-driven.

## 🧩 Interaction Summary

| Aspect | PDCA | OODA |
|------|------|------|
| Trigger | Stakeholder impulse | Time / environment |
| Nature | Reactive | Proactive |
| Question | “How do we do this?” | “Should we do this?” |
| Frequency | On demand | Scheduled |
| Role | Execution | Orientation & judgment |

## 🧠 Essence

> **PDCA executes.**  
> **OODA judges.**  
> **Together they prevent blind execution and analysis paralysis.**
